# dbProject
The databases project for creating a pizza ordering system.
Now I can retrieve the pizza ingredients, calculate the price of a pizza and determine id it vegan/vegetarian,
only by knowing its ingredients. - this is done, and it works by connecting to the DB.
Also, now the registration and login of customers works with the DB.
I can estimate the cooking time of the order.
The customer can cancel the order within 5 minutes after placing it.
